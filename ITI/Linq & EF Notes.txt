What is [ Proxy in C# ]


------------------- [ Qeustions ] -------------------

enable lazy loading by adding keyword 'virtual' to the property
      
what is .Include(), .Load()

what is intial data retrieval?

what is include method used for 

what is InverseProperty ?

what are database initialization strategies?   [ CreateDatabaseIfNotExists / DropCreateDatabaseIfModelChanges / DropCreateDatabaseAlways ]

what is 'using' keyword

what is discard '_'  like in _= new connection() instead of Connection context = new connection()

what is migration history table ?

attributes like key and composite primary key how to make it 


var something dynamic determine the data that it referring to in compile time unlike js

[Eager / Deferred ] Execution

// eager execution => sub_routine

// deffered execution => co-routine


var Query = from d in SampleData.Departments where d.Name.Length > 3 select d;

int Query = (from e in SampleData.Employees where e.Salary > 2000 select e).Count(); 

Query Expression 
pipline
aggregate function 

TakeWhile(e=>e.name.lenth<5); -- takes lambda Expression
what is different between takewile and where ??
	where check all the list 
	takewhile if the condition become false it will stop checking what is next if even there is a match for the condition

skipwhile()take lambda expression
	-- after first match will take it and the restof the list weither matches or not 

first, firstOrDefault, Take, TakeWhile, Skip, SkiopWhile, 

join @ subQuery

var Query = from e in SampleData.Employees from d in SampleData.Departments where e.Department == d select new {e.Name, d.Name};
foreach(var item in Query){console.WriteLine(item.Name);}

var Query = from e in SampleData.Employees join d in SampleData.Departments on e.Dpepartment equals d select new { e.Name, DeptName = d.Name };
foreach (var item in Query){console.WriteLine(item ... }

var Query = SampleData.Employees.Select(e=>new {e.Name, DepName = e.Department.Name}

// sub Query
var Query = from d in SampleData.Departments select new { d.Nam, Employees = from e in Sampledata.Employees where e.Department == d select e.Name};


or sub-query 
IEnumerable 

region Casting
// error, Cannot Implement IEnumberable 
var Query = from e in SampleData.GetEmployee() select e;

1-- not the best 
@var Query = from Employee e in SampleData.GetEmployee() select e;	-- casting every object return to [employee]
	-- high risk for object not type of employee [Not Safe]

2-- not the best 
@var  Query = from e in SampleData.GetEmployee().Cast<Empolyee>() select e; -- casting all the returning object to Employee
	-- high risk for object not type of Employee [Not Safe]

3-- most used [ More Safe ] called [ Safe Casting ]
-- cast to IEnumerable<Employee>
@var Query = from e in SmpaleData.GetEmployee().OfType<Employee>() select e; -- convert it to IEnumerable of Employee (just convert the object from type IEnumerable<Employee>

lab
using 2 method [ sub-Query / joni / relation .. differentiate


=========== [ Day Two ] ==============
application = [A medium] = database

ef is a medium layer [ EF API ] called [Entity Data Model] => Contain [ Conceptual Model / Mapping / Storage Model ]

we are using LinQ to deal with EF that Deal with the data source

deepy context lite weight from EF [unrequired functionality removed]
object context is old version but deepy context is new and light weight 

install to the project 
three methods to work with EF
	- [ new item in the project ]
	- [Data] [ADO.NET Entity Data Model] 
	
	- database first [ EF Designer from database]
	- [Empty EF Designer model] not working in the industry
	- [Emply Code First Model] Code First - Most Common Used
	- [Code First From Database] Mixed Mode for complex projects [ Classes + 

	IP Address
connection string contain all the data for connection details
app.config is like bios tells how the application should work 

which version of EF [6.x / 5.0] // choose the latest

what is DbContext (entity framework)
concurrency mode 
navigation peroprty

CompanyEntity 

// connection string must have name // we can obtain more that one connection string // stored in app.config
CompanyEntities context = new CompanyEntities();
what is different between IQueryable and IEnumerable?
What is Expression Tree [respnsible for converting c# query to sql server query

var q = context.Department.Select(d=>d);

$$$-eager laod, lazy load, Explicit load, IQueryable, IEnumerable, when to use each one on different business cases

explain what happened here
var q = context.Departments.Select(d=>d).Where(d=>d.ID>); // $$
search for it 

performance and memory overload [ deferred / eager ] which case make me chose which one

to convert from deferred to eager we pub .ToList()
var q = context.Departments.Select(d=>d).ToList.Where(d=>d.ID > 10);
explain what heppned here$$

context.Database.Log = Console.WriteLine; // show all states

Department Dept = context.Departments.FirstOrDefault();
dept.Name = "UpdateDept";

context.SaveChanges();	// 
context.Entry(Dept).State=System.Data.Entity.EntityState.Modified  // this line occurs autmatically 
context.Entry(Dept).State=System.Data.Entity.EntityState.Add
context.Entry(Dept).State=System.Data.Entity.EntityState.Delete
context.Entry(Dept).State=System.Data.Entity.EntityState.Detached
[ Unchanged/ Modified ]
// search for it 
Department dept = new Department(ID=, NAME='', ...);
context.Departments.Add(dept);
context.SaveChanges();


Department Dept = context.Departments.FirstOrDefault();
context.Departments.Remove(dept);
context.SaveChanges();

[Relation] we don't have join because we're working C#

var q = from e in context.Employees select new {e.Name, DeptName=e.Department.Name};
foreac(){}

Department NewDept = new Department(){ID = 26, Name= "TestRelation"};
Employee Emp = new Employee (){Name = "EmpRelation", Department = NewDept};
context.Employees.Add(Emp);
contxtl.saveChanges();

Department newDept2 = new Department(){}
Employee emp2 = new Employee(){Name = "empRelation2", Department = emp.ID};
context.Departments.Add();
context.saveChanges();

//include foreign key with the model // Search for it 

// adding stored procedure 
	// browser model show 
view/ table => class
stroed procedure => function 

ef can't understand the return of the stored procedure so we determine it by ourself 
	-- go to model browser and the name of the proc in function imports and change it to entity with the name of the class that we know it will return data from that type
	-- return a collection Of

what is DbSet // IQueryrable
concurrence mode 


============== [ Day Three ] ================
the deferred execution occurs when you enumerate the results by using the foreach or ToList() ToArray()

what is ToList(), ToArray() search for it ??

[databasefirst] we took yesterday !

relation in C# search!

dependent is the foreign key that is pointing to the primary key [Princible Key] 

relook at the relation region in the demo // why we send it as newDept and the different between send it as the dept.id 

(@"") what is the purpose of the '@' symbol

concurrency mode // check before savechanges that the value as excpected 
but lower the performance and extra amount consumed in memory [ OriginalValue / CurrentValue ]

TimeStamp Search!!

Entris is an array in the exception that holds all the objects that a problem occured to it 

var value = ex.Entries.First(); // get the last object add to the list 
value.Reload(); // select again from the beginning to update the value // can't detect wich column have problem occured so it reload the all the columns (Row)

value.OriginalValues.SetVAslues(value.GetDatabaseValue());	the same as the previous two line inside the catch 
	// here we set the original value that added from the concourrency mode 
	// value.GetDatabaseValue() Search!! // it get the values from the database again as the [ value.Reload() ] 

also we have a getValues like setValue search!!

each context has its own try-catch 

what is custom error handling

what is documentation in C#?

============================

what is dataware house ?

what is netget package manger ==> search for entityframework (not the core version)	work with the latest stable version !!

if there is no internet connection get the ef from the package from an old project

how to add connection string to the app.config

in the datacontext class that inherits from dbcontext in the constructor of the datacontext 
public context():base(name of the connection string )	sent it to the dbcontext constructor with the connection string name 

what is DbSet //implemented in the datacontext class // is the table that create in the sql server when adding it to the sql server //context.add(dept)

what is migration history a table in the sql

ID column auto detected and will by default set it as primary key 
and if it numeric will set it Identity and not null

any reference type by default will make it allow null

context.add // automatically savechanges [affect the database] // only will create the table without adding the objects created 
	-- to add it we have to write context.saveChanges(); // this will save the object to the [binded table] that we add it to the context 

the created table in the database is the name of the DbSet<>

migration is the mapping of c# to database [migration]

class Database is existed if the datasource is sql

Database.SetIntializer<dataContext>(strategy) like [ drop... ]

what is model in ef?

model is the structure of the table, each row record considered as model

if the database is in use we can't modify or drop any table $$ like if we open the ssms and we're trying to modify the database from the visual studio 

what is attributes in C#
	addtional infromation that maps over a class

what is data annotation use the attrubutes 

[table(""myDept,schema="newschema")]
internal class{}

[key]
[Column("ID")]
public int deptID {get;set;}	// here the key is information for that line [ next line ]

[Required] -- make the name not allow the null [ attributes ] 
[]	// we can add more than one attribute in sperated line or sperated by comma on the same line like [,]
public string Name{get;set;}

to be able to use the data annotations we have to add using namespaces for the data annotation


// in c# corner 
// search for that snippet 
[Timestamp]
public byte[] TimeStamp{get;set;}


seperate which one to use [ Code First ] or [ Database First ]
which functionality we should focus on when use each case !

what is fluent API or AI ??$$

how to handle relations like one to many or many to many 

one to many we add the a list in the many

inside the department list of employees and it will directly understand that a relation 

// InverseProerty search!!
https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/code-first/inverseproperty-dataannotations-attribute-in-code-first.aspx

many to many relation we put list on both $ it will autmatically create new table and understant that it's a many to many relation

what is descriptive attribute // create new class with both lists of each and with the descriptive.

composite attribute search!
	-- no ID prop or [key] attribute
	-- no user-defined datatype must all be primitive type 
	-- must be object only inside the other class [not list]
	-- if we add a user defined datatype it must be [ complex type & must add [ComplexType] attribute & object not list ]
