[ Iqueryable ] [ ICollection ] 

Iqueryable is something that deals with sql 
we write c# query and map take place then execute sql 
connected mode make a connection and get all the data
disconnected mode open get data and close and open and get and so on

the result from ef if its type is IEnumerable it means that its a collection and it's like a select all and the condition (filteration) in memory $$

			type is IQueryable the comming result is after filteration ( filteration done in sql [ condition in sql server ] )

we know which one in the entity framework

which is better, it depends on the required case, you want to 

what is diefferent between the IQueryable and IEnumerable 

search for built-in interface 
IFormatable => like tostring()
IDisposable  => close the connection 
IComparable => have function called compareto()
	-- List<Employee> liemp = new List<Employee>()
		{ new Employee(){id=,name=,} }


----- -- [ List Creation ] -- ---------

	@ List<int> Li = new List<int>();
		Li.Add(10); adding 10 to the list
		Li.Add(12);
		-- this list is unsorted 
		Li.Sort();	-- this line will sort the data inside the list 

		foreach(var item in Li)
		{ console.writeline(item);}

		-- we use var because we don't know the type of the data inside that list
		
--	[ Creating List from Employee ] 	--

List<Employee> liemp = new List<employee>();
	liemp.Add(newEmployee() {id=,name=,address=})	adding data from type employee to list (li)
	liemp.Add(newEmployee() {id=,name=,address=})
	and so on to add more than one employee

	-- not sorted -- and if we want to sort it we should specify I will order it by what ( id , or name 
	
	-- if we write item.sort() it will be sorted depend on what??
		-- there will be an exception that says ' failed to compare the two elements' 
		-- sort() function depend on Icomparable and in the error it says that 
			-- Icomparable takes one item at a time

	-- then we can inherit the interface Icomparable on my object that I want to compare and sort 
		-- I must also include the interface method to implement it inside my class
		
	public int compareto(object obj)	return 1,0,-1 look for it?
	inside it I Cast the object as employee
	{
		Employee emp = (Employee) obj -- casting obj as Employee
		-- uncertain object -- main include idfferent data object like in arrays 
		
		-- I should make sure that the obje is employee
		if (obj is Employee)					$$ check if the obj from datatype employee
		{put the code that have casting here ...}

		return 0 if both are equal
		return 1 if bigger than
		return -1 if smaller than 

		search for compareto i c# documentation

		int x; 
		x.compareto	
	
		IComparable $$ compareto()

		var is implicit type local variable 
			-- cannot be declared global unless it declared in local scope must be inside a scop			
			-- implicily typed, he knows its type implicilty depends on the type of the variable  type
				( detection for the value type implicitly )
		
		so it must be intialized 
		what is different between the collection and list

		creating dictionary
		Dictionary<int,Employee> dic = new Dictionary<int,Employee>;	key is int, value is employee type
		dic.Keys is int	and is readonly
		dic.values is the type of the values inside the dictionary
		

	var is implicitly type local variable

	how to edit keys in the dictionary 


-- [ Exception Handling ] --

	-- syntax error
	-- runtime error
	-- logical error
	

how to handle these cases by giving a hint to the client about what happneded and becuase of what

types of exception
	-- format exception 
	-- dividebyzeroexception
	-- nullreferenceexception
	-- indexoutofrangeexception
	

we use try and catch to handle exception

try{}catch(FormatException FEx ){}catch(NullRefgerenceException FEx){}	-- fex hold all the data for that type of exceptions
we can obtain more than one catch

Exception ex = new FormatException();

catch(Exception excep) refer to any typeof the exceptions because it's the parent for all exceptions
{
	excep.Message -- have the message of the exception type 
	excep.Source  -- have the name of name space and class but must be in different class not the program of main
	excep.InnerException 	--
}

we can obtain specific exception and general exception but specific must be at first then General excption not the opposite
we could make the excption handler tell the user to contact the developer

look for cutstom exception $$$

create my own exception 
	-- business tell a specific type of exception 
creating userdefined exception
	-- we create a class with the exception name that we would to specify and this class must inherit from the parent Exception
and now we want to fire that excetion by using throw keyword
		throw new SalaryException();	
		where this is the name of the class that inherit from Exception

we put it inside the property get or set conditions

userdefined exception $$

try{} catch(){} finally{will be executed in any way wiether it executed or not!}
the purpose of the finally block it is necessary for executing something that  Iwant to make sure to execute it weither an exception happened or not 
	like closing the connection to make sure to close it

-- [ Generic ] --
List<int>	...
List<string> 	...
List<employee>	...
		
all are mapping to class list but with different datatypes of the value that it holds
-- so we made a class called list but it's Generic class 
	we can use it in many shapes like different datatypes [ resuable ]
		-- so there is generic that I could use lists with primitive datatype or userdefined datatype
Generic is a method that makes the class usable with any types and change the behaviour of that type 

to make any class a Generic we add '<>' beside the name like:

@
class Listg <T>{} creatin a generic class that accepts any datatype 
	-- T refer to the type$$
and we should convert all the member to generic like him ofcourse except the index is int

could we make a generic method inside a non-generic class
	-- we must make the method generic at first before make it accept generic parameter like:
	@ public void print<T>(T date){}
	
	@ emp.fun<int>(c);	-- we can not to set the <int> becuase the compiler will make it implicitly depend on the intered value datatype
	like @ emp.fun(c); 	-- he knew it from the paramerter

we could make public static void print <t> (t data){}	

public void comparetwoitme<T> (Titem1, T itme2){}

public T print<T> (T input){return }

struct, class and T in generic	-- generic constraints
indexer, custom list, collection, 


===================== [ Day Two ] ====================

lost generic constraint 

-- Indexer $$


public override string ToString()
{
	return string.Format("",)
}

list.insert will modify or will insert and shift -- list method

array of employee when making a property for it for set and get when using get it will return a reference for the list of employees
we could create another array of employee and assign it with the get for the previous employee

should we use a function to set the value or an index to set it 

we make an insert function and add function 

what is collection in C#?

What is different between Collection and List?

What is Indexer?
	-- It's a property but not have a name
	-- but we write this because it refer to the class
	-- and we decide the type of this indexer

public Employee this [int Index] {} 
$$ so What is the main purpose of the indexer?

--	--	[ Indexer ]	--	--

public Employee this [int index]
{
get {return ArrEmp[index];}
set {ArrEmp[index++] = value;}
}

so with indexer  we can deal with the list of employee as a normal array and now 
I'll be able to use Employee[indexValue] = -- becuase it have an indexer

instead of write emplist.ArrayEmp[5] with indexer we will be able to use emplist[5] directly

-- property its name is this and take the parameter
-- we could have more than one indexer but 
	-- we have to change the signature ( parameter data type [ function overload ] )

-- also we could add logics inside set and get of the indexer

-- if we used the index with string parameter to set and get with a string value inside the indexer 
	we'll use the if condition and loop over the array to find the index that have value that match the string index
	and if the condition became true it will assign that index to a variable and set or get based on the matched index

-- we could have an indexer with more than one parameter 
public Employee this [string Name, int index] -- we use it when we deal with it as a collection that takes index and value


	-- [ IEnumerable ] --
any collection we could use with it foreach	

what is enumerator?

from IEnumerable Definition$$
public Ienumerator GetEnumerator(){}
returns an IEnumerator (returns Interface)

-- open the definition of Inermerator you will find something
-- we can't create an instance from the interface 
-- what is inner class and outer class
-- outer class is the normal one that we use 
-- inner class is a class that inside an outer class
	-- the advantages

current, movenext, reset is inside the inermerator interface
public Ienumerator GetEnumerator()
{
	-- we can't implement the Ienumerator inside attributes
	-- so here we can create inside a class that can implement the  IEnumerator 
	-- and after that we can use its attributes 
	return new Iterator(ArrEmp);		-- go inside the iterator [ current, movenext, reset ]
}
class IteratorInnerclass : IEnumerator

{
	Empoyee [] Emplis;
	// constructor 
	public iterator(Employee [] Arr){Emplis = Arr}

	public Current => throw new sss;
	bool MoveNext(){}
	void Reset(){}
}

-- we want to use foreach with emplist
and then we use IEnumerable and IEnumerator
IEnumerable have public Ienumerator GetEnumerator()	-- we can't return an Interface but we can return something that Implement that Interface

Ienumerator have object Current get
	bool MoveNext();
	void Reset();

so we create an inner class to be able to return and we will do it like return new Iterator();

-- which Iterator() is the inner class 

class Iterator : IEnumerator
{
	-- we need reference to deal with it using the blow methods $$
	-- we will make a constructor to recieve the array
	Employee[] empArr
	public Iterator (Employee [] emparr)
	{
		-- now we get the reference of the emparr to use it inside the iterator class
		empArr = epmarr;
	}	

	-- also we need an iterator index for it 
	int Iindex;

	-- this property returns the current element and increase the index
	public object Current 
	{
		get { return emparr[Iindex++];}
	}

	-- this mehtod know if a read have been read before or not by returning boolean value that make it clear
	public bool MoveNext()
	{
		-- if there is another data to read it will return true if not it will return false
		return Iindex < emparr.length;
	}	-- if it true it will call the object Current and increase the index and comeback here again to check again 
		-- foreach make them automatically 
		
	-- it reset the index of iterator to zero after finishing it
	public void Reset()
	{
		Iindex = 0;
	}	-- foreach at the end will make it autmatically 
}

-- we only have to provide these methods for foreach to be able to iterate over them 


filling the methods of the iterator 

IEnumerable => public IEnumerator GetEnumerator (){return innerName(referenceToTake)}

	class innerName : IEnumerator 	
	{
		reference variable 
		index
	
		-- constructor that set the reference 
		innerName(type Name){ reference variable = Name }	
		
	
		Current property that get the reference of the specified index
		{return reference variable[index++]}	
	
		MoveNext() return true if there is another index to read-- the index value is less than the reference length
	
		Reset () set the index to zero after when MoveNext become False
	}

-- we are going to make a little change 
	-- add another constructor
	instead of send array we will send the class using constuctor

	change the GetEnumerator (){return Iterator (this);}
	-- and then recieve inside the constructor

	and then change all data that were refer to the reference variable and change it to emplist[Iindex]

	[Current]
-- get {return emplist[Iindex++];}	
	
	[MoveNext()]
-- index <= empli.index; -- on each add in the empli the index prefix then foreach will print x times that is equal to the last input of the list not all the length

	[Reset()]
-- Iindex = 0;

-- how does for each work?
	go to collection and call GetEnumerator()
		GetEnumerator() call Iterator()
			Iterator Implement IEnumerator [ Current - MoveNext - Reset ]
				Iterator have Iindex, object from outer class that have indexer
					Iterator have constructor with the object from outer class that have indexer

-------------------------------------
| simulating What [foreach] Do $$$  |
-------------------------------------
IEnumerator obj = emplist.GetEnumerator();
wihle(obj.MoveNext())
{
	Employee empObj = new obj.Current as Employee; 		-- casting also we can make it -- (Employee) obj.Current
	Console.writeLine(empObj));
}
obj.Reset();	-- after that function we can repeat the while loop again to print again 
		-- without setting Iindex to zero the obj.MoveNext() will return False $$
wihle(obj.MoveNext())
{
	Employee empObj = new obj.Current as Employee; 		-- casting 
	Console.writeLine(empObj));
}


-- [ Collection ] --
we could use 
	class list2<T> : List<T> {}	-- instead of implementing IList we use List<> becuase I don't want to modify the interface methods and List Implement it 

========================== [ Day Four ] ===============================================
              -- [ Event ] --

we are trying to simulate the event concept 

here we have an issue with that method 
- because of assiging the delegate to null 
it will remove the added methods so ... 

we create the object at first and we made the subscription for each one ( subscription )
we have to make it in the creation of the object ( in the constructor ) 
the constructor takes the subscription name as from publisher class 

- we create the constructor that takes the published as a parameter and take the subscription of the publisher and add method to the delegate of the publisher 
	-- outer subscription solved and became in the creation of the object 

-- still we have an issue [ null assignation ] 
	-- to solve it we have to disallow the listener to control the publisher 
	-- to solve it we can a keyword that will fix this issue 'event'

here we make it forbidden to use equal only += or -= so we can't assign null any more 
now for each listener can add him self or remove him self from the delegate 
but we also have another problem is it possible to the listener to more that one publisher 
we make another publisher have list of info and method to add to this list 

@ public event Action<string> MagDelegate; it's a delegate that accept only += and -+ only$$$

after adding event keyword to the delegate its shape will be changed to sparkle 

we also have to have constructor inside each listenr that add its method to that new publiser

constructor with the input publisher to add the method to publisher's delegate 
we now need after recieving notification how to know which make this action from magazine or publisher
so we have to provide the sender to know who send that action 

we edit to add the methods of the listeners and add another parameters [ object sender ]
	also we modify the delegate and add the added parameter typt to the delegate 
	and modify the publisher method that send info to call the delegate and in the added parameter send 'this' keyword to make it know who sent that action 

	in the methods of the sender we have something called [typeof / GetType()] to make it know the sender or which publisher [ in the listener ]
	
publisher 	[ subscription / list / addtolist own delegate ] 
listener  	[ subscription / printmsg / constructor add to delegate ]
subscription 	[ delegate refer to listener function with event keyword to prevent the 

get get the type of the sender using obj.GetType() and print it with the sender message to know who own it 

we can get the obj.GetType() in [ Type Variable ] 
Type holds the Type of the obj

we make class for the message that holds the recieved message and the [ content ] and the Author [ Author ] and the date time [ Time ]

so we edit the string msg to class msg and send object from it

we edited the listener method to take obj this and the class msgArs that have [ content / Author / Date ]
	-- after that we have to edit the delegate definitio to be able to refer to that methods

in the publisher when invoking the delegate 
	we make it send [ this, new MsgArgs(){content, author, date}; ]
and then the listener message holds all that data 
so every publisher sent this and its data

we have delegate type called EventHandler 
public delegate void EventHandler < object sender, EventArgs e> built-in used with events so we will replace the action with that delegate 
there is two types for it [ generic and non generic] 
the generic offer to add the type of the EventArgs and it's suitable with the funcitons we made in the listener

if i want to change the format of the data that I want the publisher to send with its message so we use 
the generic version with our own class that have our own format 

standard of any event we see is that shape [ object sender, MsgArgs e ] [ STANDARD ] also void
all events must be void [ delegates refer to void methods ]

we then modify the method inside the publisher to send [ this / new EventArgs() ]
when creating the event  I'm controlling the args by using generic and add my own
as a listenr I use it not contorl it and recive the data as it is
void method considered as actions 

custom control $$ search for it and how to fire an event
Windows Forms app 	[ desktop application ]

[designer] + [ main code ] 	=> partial class two of them with the same name [ partial ]

[designer section] auto generated code 
	intializeComponent = resposible for drawing on form1 box [ gui ] something like this
from tool box when adding a box from it its code automatically generating inside that function [ intialize Component ]

any control have a collection of events to show it go to  spark icon in the right of the screen 
	browse for that events for each individual component 

when firing an event it invoke the event of the fired like the same shape of the function in the listener with object sender and eventArgs e
if we found eventArgs we can't depend on it because it have no information 
but we can find another something that don't have event args
like in mouse mouve will find MouseEventArgs then you will find the e that holds information about the fired event 
all of this in the [designer section]

choose the event and double click it will fire it and show 
userdefined control , custom control, thread, 
desktop application 
delgate directly dealing with
buttom, text box
send information from form to another form 
[ Controls ]

[LAB]
amount and type 
	minus it from the dictionary 
when low make it call the supplier to get more products supplier is the listener 








============= [ Day Five ] ===================

-- [ Control ] --
the form window called a control 
there is container that holds more than controls

any control have a coupe of properties and events
properties like the appearance and behaviour
we can add images as background for any element 
we can modify the image layout like center or stretch
we can modify the font so by modifying the properties of the form [container] it affects all the elements inside it
we can add icon for the application 
window state specify the size of the screen at running application

before the load of the form this method form1_load invoked before the form starting so that's why we are 
we can't do any thing to the form unless the formload finish 

app.config holds all the config to my application 
class program is the code that we add
application.run(neform());	-- this function is responsible for running the first form that will start the application 
-- so it will create an object from the form that is going to run with you 
andbecause we have more than one form so at the main we specify which form the main function inside the program

Applicastion.Run(); -- block function -- running all the time as long as you are running the application until you close the applicatio 

how to run more than one form and who to multitask between them independently 
we create another form and add it to the application run so that it will run at first on application starting 
application.enablevisualstyle() -- enable the preset style for the form

how does form work?
	-- we dragging the element to the form and name it and use it in the context 
form is a partial class have to file partial 
	[ one for the designer that added auto generated code for the element that we added in the form window
each element have some properties [ statndard and modified by me ]
any modification will affect the properties of that element on the designer file

created references for each control - crated new object for all the controls - then adding the standard properties for object created for each control

form constructor call the intializeComponent();
	-- inside the intialize component 

there is a collection of Controls

this.Controls.Add(this.button1);	-- adding the component to the container 

reference - object - properties - add to the collection that belongs to the collections of the Control Form
create	    create   set           add

we are trying to add it manually programmatically
	so any action in any file will affect the other immediately 
	-- the code is run the code to give you the shape in the that we see in the designer but can't interact with it 
	-- so it's already running so that you can say the simulation in the designer 
	-- the code in the designer programmatically not belong to us as a devloper
	-- so we use the wizrd to set objects and set properties for each one 
	-- but we add the events 

Note: any thing we make it with wizard we can make it with code $


this code works in run time 

which code runs first then ??

sometimes we have to go to the code could you add more products after sending the application to the client
	-- so we have to make it 

to make the button have an action on click 



	in the form class partial 
	-- Button btn = new button(); -- create new object for the button 
	-- btn.text="Button";	
	-- btn.size = new Size(200, 50);
	-- btn.location = new Point(100, 30);
	-- btn.ForeColor = Color.Gray;

	// adding to the form 
	-- this.Controls.Add(btn);

	// btn click by default
	// it will be automatically updated in the designer code
	btn.Click += Mouse_Click;

	// we create the method that the event will point to
	// naming the method [ name of the control - name of the event ]
	private void Mouse_Click( object sender, EventArgs e)
	{
	}	

	// to ptint a message we use 
	MessageBox.show("text");


there is an event called mousemove for the form have an object with details mouseeventArgs e
@this.BackColor=Color.FromArgb(e.x%255,3.Y%255, e.Y%255)

private void Form1_MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
{
	// changing the background 
	this.BackColor = color.FromArgb(e.X % 255, e.Y % 255, e.Y % 255);	
}

-- text box is the contol that we write into it texts in the run time 

there is events for focusing on the text box and out moving out of the tet box 
-- password char 
readonly -- 
-- tapindex ??	tapindex is the first focus and then move while clicking on the tab key
we can modify the tabindex for each control 
different between the name and the text 
in the code I'm dealing with the name in the code 
but text is the text that showing in the button
name in design section andthe text in the appearance section 

focus on the standard naming for the controls like button is Btn_des	the button and the description between them 
button 	=> btn_log
text  	=> txt_username
	 [ the cotrol name _ control description ]

txt_username.BackColor = color.gold;

view => tab order to show the order of the tap index in all the controls

picture box -- its a place that allow me to add a picture 

prepare two forms - click on 

in the control event that I want him to open new form 
inside it we write 

Home h = new Home();
h.Show();	

// for seding data from one page to another 
	// send it through the constructor of the other form and then use it there to print it or put in another control

what is the other way to take the data from form to another like passing the data to the other form contructor

to reflect on the opened form instead of open new one every time 
we can make a property and this property that talk to the text box 

in the control button in the click event inside it
	creat new home form called h
	then h.show

Home h;		now h = null by default

application dealing with database [ entity framework ] 
insert update delete select and all
	[ button / checkbox / text box / grid / tab / in d i form / menu strip / context menu strip / ]
	
testing in the project [ testing / oop / database [ ef or ado ] / delegate / event like custom control (user control) / ... ]

[ Controls / data grid view / group box / Panel / ... ]

================ [ Day Six ] ==========================

we can add validation condition for the text input to insstead of !="" we can make it txt_name.text.length <  8 to make the name must contain more that 8 characters 
for text box we have a property called MaxLength we can change it to make it able to write only specific number of characters
diabled and readonly differences is that we can put the cursor in the read only but disabled can't 
any control can be enabled or disabled by true or flase
we can change the shape of the form [ transparentkey / pen?? ]
transparentkey transparent specific color in the form 
images saved in the resources 
radio button used when there is only one select from multiple

txttext.Font = new Font(txtfamily, txtsize, italic or bold)
autocomplete features on Misc section in the properties
	-- add to the collection and then it will be suggesting while writing in the text box
 
autoCompleteCustomSource
numeric updown is a control for numbers only
domain updown is a control for the domains and we add the name to its collection 
addRange(takes array or a collection)

selectedIndex get the index of the item inside the collection
selectedItem get the item that selected in the collection but its object 
	-- if need to use it in another txtbox so we have to cast it 

-- [ Container ] --

[ panel ] 	any control inside it it become in the panel collection
	-- when adding control to the paned, this control added to its collection 
[ group box ] grouping element with specific characterstics and colors

[ compobox ] 
property dropdown style in the properties [ choose and write, choose only, ... ]
dropdown height/width [constrol the size of the dropdownlist ]

using add or addrange to adding texts in the compobox it will not add any selected by default
	-- we can use the selected index to set it manually ...

	this method is called binding

[ datasource ] used in binding collection data like table or list or ...

@combobox.datasource = li;	where li is a collection
	and it will automatically select the first element unlike using add or addrange 

what is ado.net ? search for it, Abdulrahman, Please 

compobox.DataSource = List<Employee>	==> here it will call the ToString() of the employee
	we have to modify it to be able to use it 

var va1 = comboBox1.selectedItem; 	here the va1 is object not employee so we have it to cast it to employee from object

get the text  in the textbox and add it to the combobox

[ displayvalue, displaymember, valuemember ] 

like the name and the value in html form 
[displaymember => choose what to display from an object
[valuemember   => choose what the value of each object in the list 

=============== [ Day Seven ] =================

-- [ Design ] --
we can allign multiple control in the same axis position from the up bar icons
to make the control take the size of the size window [Anchor] 

[Anchor] make the control resize it self with resizing the window 
	-- also we can make it move only without any strecth by making it anchor from one direction
	-- by making move in more than one direction it will be strecthed
	-- the default it top left 
	
[Dock]	-- make the control take a specific part of the screen like [ top/ left/ right/ down/ center]
		-- like panel ar aside section if you make it in right or left 
		-- we can dock a control to make it top and another control to take the right to make a layout
		-- higher priority depend which one created first 		
		-- the docked control stretch it self 
		
[TableLayOut] 	-- just for oraganizing the controls 
	-- it's like a grid to easily organize the controls 
	-- like table 
	-- we can edit the column or row by numbers in the wizard
	
-- there is something we make it easier to design like 
-- there is tools that's make you choose for example a text box it makes you deteremine what you will use it for, like validation or password with its logic validation
-- third pary tool look for it 

[ menustrip ] 
	-- automatically dock in the top 
	-- to make a bar like navigation or have something like [ file / edit / view ]
	-- not best practice to make it deep tree [ making too many subitems ]
	-- instead make it to open another form and determine all of what he wants
	-- we can add a combobox in the subitem to the menustrip item, also we can add a seperator to seperate between the upper and lower part of the the subitem
	-- how to make shortcuts to any item
		-- [shortkey] Property to make a shortkey for the selected control
		-- [shortkey display string] that will appear beside the item that you want to make a short key for it 
		-- we add event for each item in the menustrip to make it do something when selected 
	
[context menu strip] 	
	-- is the menu that will appear when pressing right click
	-- note that it won't appear unless it connected to a specifc control
	-- in any control property there is a property called contextMenuStrip => connect it with the contextmenustrip 
		-- mean that every location over any control have a specific context menu strip 
		-- so that we have to connect it to a control to be able to open it when right click on it 
	-- [create ContextMenuStrip] => [Link it with a specific Control or the container or even a panel ]
	-- search for the sender in menuStrip sender object in the event metho

[MDI] -- making a container for another forms [MDIForm]

	-- making a form can't move outside the parent form
	-- so the parent form that limit the move of another form must be [MDIForm]
	-- in the property of it there is [isMidContaier] property set it to true to make it accept another child form to be child for it 
$$	-- in the child form we have to make it f4.mdiparent = this; $$$
		// write the screen here 
		@Form4 f4 = new Form4();
		@f4.MdiParent = this;		-- here we assigned the MDI parent to the child form 
		@f4.show();

	-- the form that have another many forms with movement limitation inside it called [ Work Space ]
	
[ToolTip]	-- is the detailed message that appears when hover over a specifc control in the form 
	-- also we have to connected with a contorl to be able to use it liek in contextmenuStrip
	-- we name it like @toopTip1.ToolTipTitle = "NameIt";
			   @toolTip1.ToolTipIcon = ToolTipIcon.Info;
			   @toolTip1.BackColor = Color.Azure;
			   @toolTip1.ForeColor = Color.Red	
			   @tooltip.SetToolTip(ControlNameHere,"Message");--takes the text and the name of the contorl to show the message on it
			   // @toolTip1.Show("Message", ControlNameHere );  -- search for how to use show 
		-- property [isBallon] to make it like a ballon
		-- also we can create it and set these properties all from wizard

[RichTextBox] -- 
	--the different between textbox and richtextbox
	-- text box only write ordinary text with adding normal format to to the entire text 
	-- but the rich text box store the text as [ Text + RTF ] also storing the format of the text
	-- we can apply different formats to different specific parts of the text unlike the text box [ all take the same format ]
	-- RTF is Format with The Text like code so that richTextBox Holds the text beside its format 
	-- for applying a text with different formats on different parts of the text [ we can use word any apply different formats ] 
	-- the word file is a richTextBox, we save the file as RTF to be able to use it in the richTextBox	
	@richTextBox1.LoadFile(@"path to the .rtf file"); @=> to make it understant that the string in between the double quotes is a path
	-- we can also save the file to rtf file 
	@richTetBox1.SaveFile(@"Path To Save The File");

		-- [Dialog] --
[fontdialog] & [colordialog] 
[ColorDialog] is we put it at a control to make it show the color dialog
	--@colorDialog.Showdialog();	-- shows the color dialog when pressing on the specified control where we put the dialog on 
	--@textBox1.ForeColor = colorDiablog1.Color;	--ShowDialiog() return a Wizard for the Color
	if (colorDialog1.ShowDialog() == DuialogResult.OK)	-- make sure that the user selected a clolor from the color dialogi 
?what is wizrd?
[FontDialog] is the same like colo
if(fontdialog1.Showdialog() == DialogResult.OK)
{textBox1.Font = fontDialog1.Font;}

[FileDialog]
if (openFileDialog1.ShowDilaog()==DialogResult.OK)	it return file name {File Path}
{
	richTextBox1.LoadFile(openFileDialog1.FileName);	-- file name is the path to that file 
}
showDialog to the file it open a File Borwser to select a file and when pressing OK it return the path
we have to handle if cancel 
	 
there is a property in the fileDialog called filter which filtering the extension of the files to be able to select 
@opernFiledialog1.Fileter= "RTF|*.rtf"; -- it must before the showDialog to filter the data before the show of the dialog not after it 

// writing *.* in the search show us all the files with all extensions

@openFileDialog.SafeFileName; -- [SafeFileName] this property holds only the name of the file name and its extension 

[FolderBrowseDialog]
if (folderBrowserdialog1.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)
{
	folderBroswerDialog1.SelectedPath; 		-- print this line to o	[ Selected Path ]
	folderBrowserdialog1.RootFolder.ToString(); 	-- print it to show the return value [ 
}

[ProgressBar]
	-- just focus on the [ Minimum / Maximum / Step / Value ] property 
value holds the current progress

[Style] property 
	Macro like loading alternating moving
	Continue

we can change it using value or progress step
progressBar1.Value += 5; -- button event do it 

if the value overload the maximum it will fire an exception then we have to check that the value must be lower or equal the maximum [ used in changing the progressbar using [value] ]

or we can use another pethod called [ PerformSte() ]
	-- resoponsible for the progress par with thre preset Step and it depend all of the above
.Maximum
.Minimum
.Step

[DataGridView] -- 
	[Enable Adding]
	[Enable Edditing]
	[Enable Deleting]
	[Enable Custom Reordering]

	dataGridView1.ColumnCount = 3;
	dataGridView1.Columns[0].Name/HeaderText = "string";
	-- so here we have a header for each column and a name for it 
	
-- to load a data from we can bind it with a table or a list 

how to add dataset to combobox or grid view
what is connectionstring for data base 
choosing datasource for the grid or the combobox [tables]

we can hide or show specific column from the grid

we can use the proc with ADO
or
there is a function call fill what does it used for 
	-- run query SQL
or SQL client
open connection through Command

	-- [ADO] --

@using System.SqlClient;
	-- @sqlCommand com;
		com = new SqlComman();
		com.CommandText="write here SQL statement";
		com.ExecuteNonQuery 	-- scalar return a value to read it 
		com.ExecutReader();	-- execute data
	-- @ sqlConnection con;
		con = new SqlConnection();
		con.ConnetionString = "";
		con.Open(); -- open connnection
	-- @ Sql Data Reader re;
		re = new SqlDataReader();	-- creating an object 
		re = Com.Executereader();
		if (re.HasRows){
-- we adding the read value to a table at first and then add it to a DataGridView
		while(re.Read())
		{
			// here we adding the read values
			richTextBox.Text = re.GetValue(0);
			// now we have to close the connection after each communication
						
		}}
-- we use GetValue because we don't know the type of the value that we are reading, after receiving it we cast it as string and show it in the grid or combobox

[Query Builder]
[dataset.asd]	tab

[Delegate View]
@int returnValue = this.Adatper.fill(dataTable);		

[ListBox][ListView][CheckListBox]

[ListBox] 	-- is a list we fill it with a couple of items
	-- using .DataSource
	-- the standard event [ selected index changed ]
	-- list box is like the combobox but listbox display all the items without clicking on an arrow to display them all
property [SelectedIndices, SelectedItems ]	look for it @$$


[CheckedListBox]	-- list of checked box	
	-- binding => checkedListBox1.Items.AddRange(Li.ToArray());	-- only accept [array] range unlike checked listbox
	-- the standard event is checkedlistChanged
property [ checkedItems/ CheckedIndices/ SelectedItems ]
	 [ checkedItems ] => return list for the checked items	

[ListView] [layout/ ColumnHeader collection Editor
propety [View] should setUp manually  like for details we have to add the header and design its shape
	-- we can the item with sub-item

careful naming the control Name because Name is used in the form in another specific 

 
[ user control / custom control / Paint ]
