[IActionResult] 
      - is an interface that represents the result of an action method in a controller
      
      Common Types of results that Implement IActionResult interface:
            - [ View Result ]
                  - represents a view that will be rendered as an HTML page and sent to the client 
                  - used when you want to return an html view as the response
                  - typically used for renderiug web pages in MVC applications
            
            - [ JsonResult ]
                  - representts data serialized as JSON that is sent to the client
                  - used when you want to return JSON data in response to an AJAX request or a web API endpoint 
            
            - [ FileResult ] 
                  - Represents a file that is sent to the client for download 
                  - Used when you want to return a file (pdf, image, document) to the client 
            
            - [ RedirectResult ] 
                  - Represents a redirection to another URL
                  - used when you want to redirct the client to a different action or external URL
                  
            - [ ContentResult ] 
                  - Represent a custom Text-based response
                  - used when you want to return plain text or custom content 
            
            - [ StatusCodeResult ]
                  - Represents a response with a specific HTTP status code
                  - used when you want to return a specific HTTP status code without a content body like what you see when page not fount [ Erorr 404 page not found]


- [ SOLID Principles ]
          - [Single Responsibility(SRP)]
                - Each class should have only one responsibility
                
          - [Open-Closed Principle(OCP)]
                - Classes, Modules, Functions, Etc.. Should be able to extend but closed for modification
                - we should be able to extend the behavior of a module wihout altering its surce code
                - Achieve that by using Techniques like Inheritance, Interfaces, and Abstract Calsses to allow for extension through new code rather than modifying existing code
          
          - [Liskov Substitution Principle(LSP)]
                - the objects of a derivd class should be able to replace objects of the base class without affecting the correctness of the program
          
          - [Interface Segregation Principle(ISP)]
                - Classes, Modules that depend on interfaces should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use
                - Classes should not be required to implement methods it doesn't need
                - to adhere to ISP, create small specific interfaces rather that large monolithic ones
                - and let classes implement only the interfaces that are relevant to them
          
          - [Dependency Inversion Principle(DIP)]
                - Promotes high-level modules (classes or components) to be independent of low level modules.
                - both should depend on abstractions
                - this priciple helps in decouple different parts of the system and makes it easier to replace or extend components without affecting the entire system

=========== [ Day One ] ==============

what is different between website and wep application    
 
[ client side technology / backend language to write business logic / database (sql, ado, ef) / data exchange format (json / xml) a way to exchange information data in two points /  understanding ( request and response ) [client server architecture] / the place that will hold the app (accessible for all users) Host ]




client server architecutre
IP adress and port required for communication

Ip adress is the address of the server and the port is the inner transportation (which slot in the server)

DNS domain name server 
URL is talking to the DNS and get the ipaddress and the port number 
there is many protocols to communicate with the server like fttp http and https

what is the relation between url and dns between the connection of client => server 
      - URL: Uniform Resource locator / DNS: Domain Name System
      - you type url on your web browser
      - your browser sends a query to a dns server 
      - the dns server looks up the ip address associated with the url 
      - the dns return the associated ip address
      - you web browser uses the ip address to conect to the web server 
      - the web server sends back the html code for the requested page
      - your web browser renders the received html code and displays that page

URL:=> protocol://domain/segment?querystring    

what is the qurey string and the segment?
      - EX: www.facebook.com/profile/settings?id=3&name=ahmed
            - here [profile] and [settings?id=3&name=ahmed] is a Segments and seperated with slash
            - [ ?id=3&name=ahmed ] is a query string 
            
hosting servers can allow hosting database and the application on one place or it may allow for only the application hosting and let you chose another hosting platform to host your application

rendering => make the response suitable for the browser when responding the data 

[client] => [Request] => [URL / DNS] => [Server (IP-Address + Ports(slots))] => [Back-End] => [database] => [Rendering] => [Response] => [Browser]
	
from server to the response all inside the server unless the database is hosted on different host server so it will go out there and then comeback to continue the path

How does the server know which person is logged in?
      - [ Authentication Tokens ]
      - [ Session Cookies ]
      - [ Json Web Tokens (JWT) ]
     
what is the relation between running the application on visual studio for web application and the iis server of the windows and the kestrel

which data does the browser send when communicating with specific server(web site)?
      - Request Headers => Contain infromation about the request [ http method / url / browswer type and version ]
      - Form Data       => data enterd in a web form such as login form  
      - Cookies         => small data stored in the browser to track user activity
      - Referrer        => contain the previous url that the user visited

in mvc5 when opening a website with two taps in the same time it will create two different response (Issue) [ Fixed in mvc6 ]

What is IIS? (different between iis and apache)
	- windows can read flash memory he knows fatt32 but mac cannot understand it (exmple)
	- to make the mac read flash format it and make it with another division that he can understant not fatt32
	- so iis and apache are different like mac and windows with the flash memory format
	- any operating system have iis (windows features [ Internet Infromation Services ]) and then restart and this to be able to open the server of the my pc
	- we can host any from project not as path but as server (ip address and port of my pc) like the live server in visual studio code
	- the default page to open we can change it from the default document in the iis manger and the name of the added website properties(all inherited by default index) in this case I made my machine a [ fit client ]	

what is apache http server?
      - like iis but from another foundation and both used for hosting web application
      
how does the pc knows which program open that extention file  (there is a translator for that)?
	-- the translator in the asp.net is [ Handler ] so the request go through the handler to translate it to the correct [open]
	-- between the request and the handler is [ Moduler ] and is responsible for [URL Rewriting ( one of its job )] / when we try to open souq it will make me go to amazon automatically, how did this rewrite [Moduler]
	-- also there is routing 
      
[ Moduler ] => responsible for URL Rewriting like souq and amazon
[ Handler ] => responsible for delegating the request for the approperiate controller
	
modify framework to 4.7.2 version 
	
asp.net application (not core) if it's empty
      - [ App_Data / App_Start / Content / Controllers / Models / Scripts / Views ] {Folders}
      - Global.asax.cs
            - inherit from HttpApplication
            - create static method 
            
                  protected void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)
                  {
                  
                  }
                  
      - we can add libraries like [ bootstrap.min.css / jquery.min.js / bootstrap.min.js / jquery.validate.min.js / jquery.validate.unobtrosive.min.js ] 
            - from client side library, Content folder is for CSS files and Scripts folder is for JS Files
            
      - [App_Start] => [ BundleConfig.cs / FilterConfig.cs / RouteConfig.cs ]
      
            to have the ability to use BundleCollection you shoule install this package 
                  - Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.Web.Optimization
            to have the ability to use the mvc return types install asp.net mvc
                  - Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc
                  
after creating the first controller it will create 
                  - the App_start files [FilterConfig / RouteConfig] 
                  - View Files also 

            note : don't create the globale.asax file just create the controller at first 

            ----------------- [ Bundles Configuration ] -----------------
                 
            => [BundleConfig.cs] 
            public static void RegisterBundles(BundleCollection bundles)
            {
              bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle("~/bundles/jquery").Include(
                  "~/Scripts/jquery-{version}.js"));
            }
            => [Global.asax.cs]
            public void Application_Start()
            {
                BundleConfig.RegisterBundles(BundleTable.Bundles);
            }
            => [Views]
            @Scripts.Render("~/bundles/jquery")
            @Styles.Render("~/Content/css")
            
Note : for bootstrap and jquery bundles [null reference error] use Bundle instead of ScriptBundle

---------------------- [ Creating database Code First ] -----------------------
      1- create the models
      
      2- add the connection strings to the web.config file 
            <connectionStrings>
                <add name="ConnectionName" [connectionString]="Data Source=[ServerName];Initial Catalog=[DatabaseName];Integrated Security=True" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
            </connectionStrings>
            
      3- create dbcontext entity for dbcontext configuration
            public class YourDbContext : DbContext
            {
                public YourDbContext() : base("YourConnectionStringName"){}   // make sure to send the name of the connection to the base
                public DbSet<YourEntity> YourEntities { get; set; }
            }
            
      4- Enable-Migrations => Add-Migration => Update-Database
      
      
      ---------------------- [ Creating Handler (auto Redirect) ] ----------------------------
 
      in App_Start Folder
      
      - Create new Class called HandlerConfig.cs 
            - inherit IHttpHandler  
            - implement the interface IHttpHander [public void processRequest(HttpContext context){context.Response.Write("message")}] and [public bool IsReusable => true;]
            - create property @ public RequestContext requestContext { get; set; }   // add using directive web.optimization to be able to use this type
            - create constructor for the handler and inject the previous property
                  @ HandlerConfig(RequestContext req){requestContext = req;}  
                  // this constructor Executed from the calling in the returning in the RouteHandlerConfig that Implement IRouteHandler interface [public IHttpHander GetHttpHandler(ReuqestContext requestContext){return new HandlerConfig(requestContext)}]
      
      - create new class called RouteHandlerConfig for routing thehandler
            - inherit IRouteHandler and Implement the interface 
                  @ public IHttpHandler GetHttpHandler(RequestContext requestContext) {return new HandlerConfig(requestContext);}
      
      - in the RouteConfig add new route 
            @ routes.Add(new Route("controller/action/a", new RouteHandlerConfig()));
            // if we have an action called index and controller called home 
                  // so the url : home/index/a will execute RouteHandler which will execute the HandlerConfig method
            // must be before the default route
           
      NOTE:// there is must be an action in the controller and the handler instead of redirect you to that action it directs to the route handler
      
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      // the other way for creating handler      
	- in the previous parameter .Requeset.
	- context.Response.write(context.Request.RawUrl)	make it write the RawUrl on the loaded page inside the method of the httpcontext (write url in the page)
	- add reference [custom handler]
	- in the web.config add the <system.webServer><handlers><add name="nameOfTheHandler" verb="*" (ger or post) type = "Customerhanlder.MiniaHanlder, CustomHander path = "*.minia"/>
	- the application will run on iis(googlechrom) and have an icno in the taskbar besideth battery icon 
	- if(context.Reuest.QueryString.Get("username") != " ")
		contest.Response.Write("this message will be printed in the loaded page if there is no ** like in the if condition ")
		- we can check for the url using @ Respone.Url.Query.Contains("username")	-- this line checks if there is anything write in username in the url
	- every extension must have handler or it will show not found
	
	
	
      ---------------------- [ Creating Module ] --------------------------
      
      - Create new Class in App_Start Folder 
            - inherit from IHttpModule and implement it
            - in Init add @ context.BeginRequest += Context_BeginRequest;
            - creating event handler called [Context_BeginRequest]
                  @     public void Context_BeginRequest(object sender, EventArgs e)
                        {
                              HttpApplication context = sender as HttpApplication;
                              if (context.Context.Request.RawUrl.Contains("Minya"))
                                  context.Context.Response.Redirect(context.Context.Request.RawUrl.Replace("d", "Default"));
                        }
            - Add Reference Module 
                  @         	
                  <system.webServer>      
                        <modules>
                              <add name="CustomModule" type="WebApplication1.App_Start.ModuleConfig, WebApplication1" />
                        </modules>
                  </system.webServer>				
	
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
	- instead of doing all of this microsoft added application layer that contain CLR
	- asp.net is the application layer that is added 
	
	active server pages (ASP) 
		[ web form/ mvc/ signalR / realtime / api / single page application ]
		
		router is module validate the url make sure it consists of two segment  the first segment is the controller name and the second segment is the action inside that controller
		router is binding the url segments with the action and controller 
            
		cshtml [ razor engine (rendering )] before the rendering 
		
		App_Date Folder contain mdf and ndf file (database data) contain minimize version sql
		app start have code that called on the start 
		content contain the css files 
		controllers first segment in the url
		fonts
		models
		scripts contain the js files
		view contain cshtml files
		- every control auto create folder in views that contain all files for the conroller
		entry point is global.asax
		
		router checks that the router contain two segments in the url 
		hanlder creates object from firstController 
		call index function from create object 
		index function returns view: views folder > first > index.cshtml 
		
		
		
	we add new conroller with specific name 
		-- add actions in the model of that controller to be able to call in in the second segment 
		-- if we want to create another view we have to add view with the same of the action in the view file that named as the controller name after that we will be able to return that view (web page)
	

	- on each request it creates an object from the wrote controller and call the function that mentioned in the action segment 
	- views => controllerName => .cshtml files
	- model => controllerName => .cs files
	- controller => name+"Controller" => .cs file 
	
	- adding new student using url we make a function that adds new student and take two parameters id and name 
		- so the url must in the first segment have the name of the controller and on the second segment must have the name of the function + ?id=3324&name=dkfld
		
	- for showing the updated value of  the student list we must make the student list static 
	
	make action that return string / json / value of the list (like json) / add new student 
	
	why we must return interface not viewResult in mvc6 search for it

razor syntax is writing in the view with extension .cshtml 

what is different between select mvc or empty and mark on mvc check box $
      create template that have at least one demo (HomeController) and extra refrences
      check box is emtpy just files only
      
routing validation modification how to 
      - create Student Class on the model
      - create Control in the controller and mush inherit from the class Controller
      - create static list in the controller 
      - make action that return JsonResult 
      - return Json(Students, JsonRequestBehavior.AlloGet);
            - AllowGet => any url request is a Get $$
      - now make the default action for the controller or write only one segment with specific word and make it understant that belongs to a specific controller and execute a specific action by default 
      - the standard slots for the segments in the url can be finded in the [url]
      - also we have routes.IgonoreRoute(----);
      - [name:/ url:/ defualts:]
            - making the variable inside {} make him understand that its a variable 
            - defaults: new {controller="home", action= "index", id = UrlParameter.Optionl}     UrlParameter.OOptional => means that its optional to write, we can write two segements only without the {id} segment 
      - to write only the name of the contorller and make him do action (by default it will search for [Index] action) so we can use it as a default 
      
      - order for contorller , action , parameter must be in this order start with controller 
      - when application start go to global.aszx and then execute Application_Start and then execute the inner intialization inside application_start function
            - here we are sending a table for routing to the RouteConfig and RouteConfig fill that table with the specified URL template {contoroller/action/id(optional)}
            {Routes.IgnoreRoute()/ Routes.MapRoute()}
                  - here Routes.MapRoute() => a single row in that added to the routeTable that send from application_start 
                  
                  @
                  routes.MapRoute(
                              name:"Route1",
                              url:"AllStudents",
                              default: control="Student", action ="index"}    -- here will get the "AllStudents" and then return it by default lke the defaults:new{// this is the real one}
      
                        )
            routes.MapRoute name:"Default" have overlaad for single parameter and it won't try the next MapRoute that hanld it so it must be last one 
                  - that's because it only check for the parameter not the url and default converter
            
            - which MapRoute from the list choosed is the one that match the parameter number and parameter matching expression (this one is an issue in mvc5 and fixed at the version 6)
      
            
- Identity reponsible for authorization [comming soon]

model binder is responsible for the passed data in view

[HTTP Verbs]      get and post      get=> query string      post=> in the body of the request

[Get] request [ URL / Segment / QS ]  => / =>  Response [ Content / Content-type / Status Code ]
      status code 200 => OK   3xx => redirection      4xx => not found        5xx=> server problem

[Post] request [url/segment/qs + content/Content-type]      -- here we are also sending data with the request 
      like if we sending arabid => UTF-8
            [Reponse] => [status code]MUST content and content-type is optional
      sometimes content is required to understand the issue is where exactly

[Put] [url/segment/qs + Content/Content-type]   Response [StatucCode]MUST content/content-type optional
      for security data we sent it with the body not as query string (POST)
      
[Delete] [url/segment/qs] the requred data to delete is in the qs       Reponsive [StatusCode]MUST content/content-type is OPtional

MVC VERBS [GET/POST/PUT/DELETE]

any request comming from url or anchor is GET   [@ Anchor]

            ========= [ Create form with two actions return View() + CreateStudent] ================
            
in the controller @ public  ViewResult Create(){return View();}
in the Views create a view with the same name as action controller by rightclick on the action to create one
                  [html Helper => write in C#]
                  @ create form with id and name (int and string) don't forget to write the name attribute to be send in the query string 
                  <form method="post" action="/Student/CreateStudent"> it opens new url (execute action in specified contorller (Student))
Create another action to return to it in the form action 
names of the parameters must be the same like the names attributes 

      - first action is to view the form
      - second action is to add the student 
      
      don't repeat the code just call the function that do that code 
            - there is a different between actions and functions 
            - use return RedirectToAction("Index");   instead of writing Index();   this will execute the action Index like writing in the url Student/Index $$
                  
                  - in the redirection [the status code is 3xx] but in the viewing data [the status code is 200]
      
      - the component that responsible for binding the name of the views to the name of the action is the modelbinder
      
      - if we make overload for the create action to do both actions but it will throw error [ambiguous] 
            -- needs more step to seperate the which one Post and which one is Get we add Attribute - dataannotation
            -- so we must mark the Post method => [HttpPost] and the other one => [HttpGet], now he knows which method to use 
            -- best practice is to make two actions with the same name and different attribute (determining which one is Post and which one is get)
            
      we could view in browser from the view file (only in mvc5) and go to view from the action that return the view also we can create view by clicking on the view that returned from the action
      
      Get is to request for data without sending body 
      Post is requesting for data and sending in body
      
we can throw erro by using return httpStatusCodeResult(syste.net.httpstatuscode.not, -- , ---)
      but there is a problem two differnet return type 
            - here we make the return type a parent for the two return types or interfac that both are implement it
            - like [ActionResult]
      
how to pass data from the action to its view & to another view with different name ?
      ViewData["Students"] = Students;    -- Its a property that will be visible in both action and its view 
      writing @ is a code block that we can write c# code after that without space 
      if i want to write statement with spaces we put it inside @{write all code here}
      viewData receives the data as object so I have to cast that object to Student => as List<mvcday2.models.Student>;
      if inside the curly brackets we added html code then we have to add @before the code but spaces not allowed unless you put it inside the @{} again
      @
            var studentList = ViewData["Students"] as List<---->
            foreach (Stuednt item in StudentList)
            {
                  tr
                        td @item.id 
                        td @item.name
                  /tr
            }
            
            write the code in C# it's better practice because the compiler will check for it if there is any error but if we used strings it will make more difficult to findout what is wrong in the code 
            
            code nugets [code without scope] @        => used with single line code without spacing
            code with scope [code block]  => @{}      => used with multiple line and many spacing 
            
      there is another property like viewData   -- works Dictionary
            - ViewBag.StudentsData = Students;  -- works dynamics       -- accept anything and automatically cast in the runtime but (autocomplete won't work with it (intilisense))
            
      and in the view file that belong to the used action 
            - ViewBag.Students in the foreach as a collection
                  - if there is any error you will discover it in the run time 
            
            -- # -- ViewData["Key"]       => Dictionary     detect error in CompileTime       need for casting 
            -- # -- ViewBag.Key           => Dynamics       detect error in RunTime           no need for cast
            
            could we use dictionary and receive it on biewbag     [Yes] because all throw data on the ViewData Dictionary with the same key     
                  -- # -- Both are referring to the pull of resources!
                  
                  
            passing data from action to View
            [ ViewBag / ViewData / Model / Session / Tempdata ]
            
            Model is a property that belongs to View (its default property) we can fill it in that view by passing the data as a parameter in the action 
            - and in the View we write @model List<Type> here it's only require the type of the passed data in the action and use model as the passed collection 
            
            ViewData and ViewBag is used for many passed data because the model can only receive one data parameter $$
                  - make one of them as model and the other use [ViewBag or ViewData]
                  - model is a directive for the View (meta data for the view before it works) [only one model can used (It's a Directive)]
            
      [Bootstrap]
            - bootstrap3 in mvc5 created project
                  - we have store that we can update bootstrap from it 
                        - holds dll package and 
                              - rightclick on project => managenugetpackage=> update to bootstap4
            
            now in the view we add bootstrap file [ css & js ] link and script with its location paths
            
      [Booswatch] have different themes with the same name of the bootstrap classes

=========================== [ Self Notes ] ======================================

      What is the HTTP Pipeline Chain of execution?
      
so the different between routing and http module is that module will edit the url to the new one and routing will pass you through the determined url without changing the url address 
      - because the url is checked from the httpmodule at first then go to the routing to know where is it want to go and bind it 
      - [ Module] able to modify the URL before Arrive to Route
      - [ Route ] Defines how URLs are mapped to controllers and actions
      
      
==================== [ Day Three ] ===================
action create view create view index

VeiwData, ViewBag, Model       [LifeTime] => Single Request Response

passing many different datatpyes to the view and determine its lifetime(make sure it's single request response)

      - [faculty] we but ICollection for students 
      - [student] we but Foreign key for faculty id and virtual property for Student Type
      - create in the controller static list for Student and Faculty 
      - fill the list for faculty and for the student with its information and don't forget the facultyId (foreign key)
      - we cerated the list in the database model (static) so we can use it with the name of the class without even creating an object because it belongs to the class
      
      - in the view we let the model know the type of the passed data to it @model List<Student>
      - we can sent the object Student in the create action and tha binder will mape them automactially
            @
                  public ActionResult Create (Student student)
                  {
                        var found = DatabseModel.Students.Where(s=>s.ID == student.ID).FirstOrDefault();    // here return Student founded or null 
                        if(found!=null)
                        {
                              return new HttpStatusCodeResult(System.Net.HttpStatucCode.BadRequest, "Not Founded");
                              DatabaseModel.Students.Add(Student);
                              return RedirectToAction("Index");
                        }
                  }
                  
      - if we try to get the view again, the data that we sent before we will not find it because it's single request response lifetime 
            - so we sent it again 
      
[TempData]
      -TempData["NewStudentID"] = PutData
      - showing note that student with id ** created successfully will disappear after refreshing the page
            - for keeping the data we write @ TempData.Keep();
      
      different between TempData and ViewData
            ViewData from the action to the action's view
            TempData from the action to another view not must belong to the view of the index
      
      TempData.Keep()   -- makes the the passed data available on the view
      
[Session]
      - Session[Key] = "Data"
      - life time is the connection with the server (also if we open another tap it will be keeped in the other tap)
      
What is the different between [ TempData / Session / ViewBag / ViewData ]?

[HTML Helpers]
      - write all view with C# code instead of using html tags
      - Anchor <a> is Get $$
      - HTML Helper Code =>               action  controller  method
                        @Html.ActionLink("Update", "Update", "Student", new{id=item.ID}, new{})
      @htmlbeginform    @htmlendform        
      
            -                                               method
            @using(Html.beginFrom("Action", "Controller", Form.Post ))
            {
            }     // automatically end form in the closing curly bracket
            
      what is the differnt between disabled input and readonly input
            - Disabled can't copy the data from it so model binder won't be able to read it
            - ReadOnly can copy the data from it so model binder would be able to read it 
      
      [@HtmlLabelfor(s=>s.Name)] takes delegate 
      [@html.TextBoxFor(s=>s.name)]
      
      using data annotation we can change all the labels using @[Display("Studnet Name")] will affect all labels that refer to the same input type name
      
      core added TagHelper
      
      look for HTML Helper Statments $$$
      
      what is databinding in C#? like Combobox
      -                                                        value|text   which faculty would be selected when opening the page 
ViewData["FacultyID"] = new SelectList(DatabaseModel.Faculties,"ID","Name", found.FacultyId);
return View(found);
      -- this instead of foreach and fill options
      
html.dropdownlist         -- path the list name and the list that we will fill the data with and the list html attribute like text and value 
-                         -- for the list we can send null if we sent the data already in the viewdata 
-                         -- if the not sended we can send the list using the ViewData with its key like ViewData[Faculties"] as SelectList -- also cast it to a Select List 
html.labelfor
html.textboxfor
html.labelfor

if we want to change the name of a label in all the form we add dataAnnotation in the class property and the html helpers will set it directly in all label that refer to the same property 

[Range(minimum:1,maximum:int.MaxValue,ErrorMessage="ID Starts From 1")]
[MinLength(3)]                                  -- by dyfault he will throw suitable error message 
[RegularExpression(@"^[a-z]{2}[0-9]{5}$"), ErrorMessage="Code should be like AA00000]         -- we can add error message beside the error of the html helpers   // MUST MAKE IT REQUIRED 

validation on server side 
public ActionResult Update(Student student)
{
      if (ModelState.IsValid)             -- if the model valid against the DataAnnotation in the htmlHelper
      {
            // if the validation is correct this code would be executed !
            var found = DatabaseModel.Students.Where(s=>s.ID == Student.ID).FirstOrDefault();
            found.Name = Student>name;
            found.Code = Student.code;
            found.FaclutyId = student.FaclutyId;
            return RedirectToAction("Index");
      }
      return View(student);   -- this code will be executed if the data is not valid 
}

adding the submit button 
      <input type="submit" value = "save" class = "btn btn-Success">

SEARCH FOR REGULAR EXPRESSIO DATAANNOTATION C#  

[ModelState.IsValie]     

@Html.ValidationMessageFor(s=>s.Name, "", new {@class=text-danger})

this is backend (server side) vaildation // you will note a refresh and then it comes back with the validation error from the server so we call it back  

if we redirect to the action Update (it will reset the input values because we're getting new request)

data-val / data-val-minlength / data-val-minlength-min            -- all written in Client Side 
making a custom attribute in html we start it with data-
but we can modify it using dataAnnotation 

we use library [jquery.validate.js] & [jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js] add it to the view file 
after that it will make validation on the client side and it ofcourse because of the HtmlHelpers

$$ but also we have to validate in both [ Client Side & Server Side ]

unobtusive validation ??

there is validation must be in server side because unique ids can't validate on it unless it checks in the server side database 
      - it will pass the format validation of the client side validation and the model but will throw error in the SaveChanges while talking to the database 
            - so we will have to put the saveChanges in try Catch


      [Html.ValidationSummary()]    will gather all error and display them in one place where this line is located

[Buddy Class] metadata

adding the data in the model ado.net entity data model 
must add [Required] on string properties 
we have to put try catch on savechanges to show the errors that happen on the database because we can't detect it either in the back nor the client side becauase it happens in the database 

validationSummary(true/false) used for what ?

summary
      HTMLHelpers in mvc
            look for different resources ??!!$$
            
            ask her for testing
            
            
            layout
            section
            bunding or bundle
            partial view
            
What is different between Collection, Queues, and HashSet? in purpose and use!
      each one are suited to different kinds of applications, And some are highly specialized to specific tasks like the blow:
      [ Collection ]    - used to represent connectinos on social websites
      [ Queues ]        - used to create task schedulers
      [ HashSets ]      - used in Algorithms 
      

=================== [ Day Four ] ====================
Code First From Database
ViewData Viewbag ViewModel 
.Include() for eager loading $$
jquery then bootstrap because it depend on the jquery library

$ THE ORDER OF SCRIPT LIBRARY
[JQuery]=>[Bootstrap]=>[JQuery.Validate]=>[JQuery.unobtosive]

new SelectList(context.Cities.ToList(), "Value", "")

ViewData[] life time single Request Response

ModelState.AddModelError("Database Error", "Error Message");

we add (Model.IsValid) in create action

@Html.AntiForgeryToken() no one can post for action just get specific data
      - foreign local hosts can't access actions and secure 
      
      buddy class save metadata for saving dataannotation
            - if you want to add display to change the property name you will drop and create database and the dataannotation will lost
            make the class partial that you will add metadata about it in the buddy class
                  in the buddy class you just add the Display for property and in the main class file you add the metadata
                  add the Table("")] Attribute with the name of it 
                  [MetadataType(typeof(name of the metadata file))]
                  
            if you want to display in arabic, you make meta data in buddy class for all properties in arabic 
      
      for drop down list we send ViewData["list"] = new SelectItem(context.tolist(), ,)
      
      - webpages like content place holder
[Shared Layout]
      - @RenderBody()
      - @RenderSection("ValidationScripts", t/false) => t/f optional to fill the content that will allow you not to use it in specific views and 
            @section ValidationScripts{code}
      @ViewBag.Title = "TabName" - this line write with the @layout
      
      [ViewStart]
            - have the default layout in case we didn't write a layout for other views $$
            - 
      each request have smaller requests for each file for linking css and js files no compression or modification for those files => bad performance
      
      how to reduce the size and make it sent in one request only that contain all files $
            - Bundles can fix these files 
            
      [Bundle] responsible for merging all filess in one file to have one request with one name and made a little modification to reduce their's size
            - in app start like route send emtpy table in fill it in the route we do the same in the bundle 
                  - mergine js files with each other or css files with each other 
                  
            inside RegisterBundles method in bundle file
            
            bundles.Add(newStyleBundle("~/Bootstrap").Include(
            "~/Content/bootstrap-grid.css",
            "~/Content/bootstrap.css"
            ));
            bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle("~/BootstrapScript").Include(
            "~/Scripts/jquery-3.4.1.js",
            "~/Scripts/bootstrap.js"
            ));
            
            bundels.Add(new ScriptBundle("~/ClientSideValidation").Indluce(
               "~/Scripts/jquery.validation.js",
               "~/Scripts/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js"
            ));
            
      and in the view file we include the files using bundles
            @Scripts.Render("Virtual name that we write in the bundle adding")
      
      instead of write [jquery.3.4.1.js] we can write [jquery-{version}.js] and he will automatically bind it with the suitable one what ever the version of the file 
      
      note : don't put two files in one bundle which one of them you would want it alone later
      
      What is partial view
      
if we want to merge two parts in views together like the listshow and create, this case can done using partial view

public ActionResult GetAll()
{
      return PartialView(context.Cities.ToList());   // this partial view merge two view.s
}

@html.Action("GetAll")
@{Html.RenderAction("GetAll");}



@Html.Partial("GetAll");
@{Html.RenderPartial("GetAll");}

action => go to the controller find the action and he show
partial => jump directly to the view without going
render => void not returning anything because it renders there 
without render=> return htmltext

$$ which one to use it depends if there is a data that require you to go to action to pass the data to the view

what is Kendo UI plugin and third-party control
what is plugin in the context of mvc and third-party control

display each school with all the students in that school
      - create ViewModels Folder and create inside it a class
      - add properties with id name and list of students
      - we can fill that class we have to options to fill it 
            - make a separated view 
            - n Tier architecture         (we are working on 3 Tier Architecture (M V C))
                  - have access layer (contain all the logics in seperated function and call it from the controller)
                  
            in the controller action of the created class
                  - we make a list of schools and iterate over it and pick all the student in that school 
                        create new schoolStudent(created class in the viewmodel)
                              iterate over schools and get all the student in that school in the created object from the schoolStudent 
                              and add the school with the list of students to the created list of SchoolStudents
                  - after that we pass that list to the view that belongs to that action 
                  foreach(the list) and get each school individually 
                        inside it we add all the students in the current item (school) and show them in the table 
                  
                  this class only for displaying the data in the specified format you want 

=================== [ Day Five ] =====================
what makes me use the partial view ?
asynchronous => AJAX
[Identity] in MVC
incase that partial view shared in more than one view then we put it in shared

make it return partialview(name of the view, data to sent with it)
when to use bind attribute?

@Html.Action("Index")   -- because we want to get the passed model      (in day four render and without render section) 
@{Html.Partial("_Index")}
not good to throw heavy c# in view

BCL / COMPILER / GARBAGE COLLECTOR / TRANSFERRING IL  => CLR

mono => small frameworks and was open source

performance of c# in small devices is not good (flutter used in small devices)

iis
server kestrel ( more performance because it contain only supported )
iis not good in handling requests 
both work together cestrel handle request and response but iss work as proxy
string pooling (request pooling)

string x="a"; string y="a"; memory reserve one place and both refer to that place

variable.GetHashCode()    -- indicate the location of the variable in memory    this called string pooling

what is ionic in mobile appication

Tightly coupling -- create an object of a class in the contsructor of another class $$

[Factory Design Pattern]
      -- create a class that contain a static function which create and return an object from a class so here we make another way that create the object unlike the Tightly coupling
      -- we achieved Single Responsibility
     
- High level class shouln't depend on another classes but could only depend on an abstraction
      - high level is the employee that use the cal class => so employee is high level
      high level class should depend on abstraction not a concrete class [Dependency Inversion Princible]
SOLID
Time [02:50:00] Record

Employee not depent on the car 
      - another class generate an object from a class through a static function and then return it 
      - depend on an abstraction (Interface Idrivable)

create a service provider class contain [ Register / Resolve / Dispose ]

what is property injection?
what is constructor injection?
what is method injectin?

      - all instead of passing all that in the main program but not secure and we're not sure about passing it
            - 
            
there is a problem that each 
      - employee need new car so we remove it and (make it not depend on the concrete class) (we make factory create it)
      - we need to change it to another vehicle type so we make it depend on an interface Drivable all 
      - employee talk to factory directly [injection]
      - service provider we put the service and he will create the object from that service and return it (instead of passing the data from the main[cause we're not sure that he will pass it!])
      - we are still talking to employee he will create new Employee with new factory/service/etc..., [IOC Container talk to it with register/resolve/dispose ]
      - IOC Container need to install Unity and we make a servce from it ["Provider"]
      - .NET Framework  : need to install Unity
      - .NET Core       : Build-in
      
      what are the dependency injection ?
            - in Unity => we have a property called [PropertyInjection]
      
WHAT IS INJECTION?

ASP.NET Core empty .net5 confibure for Https
- web application is console application in Core &&

what is different between the console application and web application ?
      - web application is a modified console application

in 2022 program + startup => program (Merged)

modified console application by adding a host to run the web application 
      
configureServices => Register (gets code by the runtime) (passing services to the container)
Configure => there is a modules we can use it called here in the core [MiddleWares]

============== [ Day Six ] ===================
asynchronous function is a function works in parallel and won't hold the other methods and works normally without waiting the asynchronous function works normally 

What is line block functiono ?
why we write await and when?		 we use it with the async function to make it depent on it because it's asynch function

what is the meaning of the multithreading ?
task work with Pooled threads (have higher performance)

what is the different between task and thread and which one is better?
	- task is better i think because I don't have to handle it (it handles it self in the background)
	
deployment 
	- self-contained
	- run-time dependent (must have sdk on the client)

iis have more issues so that we established new one calles kestrel server and iis works as reverse proxy

working with the dotnet on cmd and package the application 

request and resolve in factory design pattern 

function - configure []
	
modules is midllewares in mvc core 

map => siting and rewriting 
run=> have only the context
use=> conditional to use to the next step or do something 
run() is responsible for running the server 

the template 
	- asp.net core web app (model view control) wep application 
	- authentication type [none]
	
dependencies => references
wwwroot => [static files rather that cshtml is placed here] = content + script

there is a ctor to the startup have configuration 

what is configuration and configuration serveces 

from action in the controller to the rendering the view is considered as servecies cycle
	- addcontrolllerwithviews()	adding more service to the servercies cycle
	
env.IsDevlopment()	-- 
we have two styles that shows the error page 
	- development mode
	- release mode
proerties => debug -> we can determine which mode we are in [development or puplished mode]
	- will differ in only the exception 
		- app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage()
		- 
blackbox testing (strange person to the inner code start testing the application)

env.IsDevleopment() 	-- checks if the devlopment mode or not 
	- app.UseHsts()		-- load the release page not the devlopment page when handling error 
	- UseStaticFiles()
	
	-- UseEndPoints();	-- lambda expression like the routeconfigure
in mvc core it return IActionResult instead of ActionResult => Dependency inversion principle

not determined function whether it get or post it not determined 
content used to return string 

what is the different between passing a parameter or passing a context in create function?

create is reponsible for create object so it's not service 
context is responsible for sending the query to the database is service because he is not responsible for get the data but it's just a service
bus model is a responsiblity 

no problem in using concrete classes here as bus object is create action's reponsiblity in [create Action]
[drive action] is not responsible for creating the bus just use it so bus here is dependency not responsiblity 
	- it's a problem if used concrete class, we should use abstracition instead of using concrete classes
	- so we pass Interface to the action fo follow dependency inversion 
	
	responsiblity => deal with concrete classes
	dependency 	  => deals with abstractions ( interfaces not concrete classes)
	
if we used the drive action we have to provide the (service provider) that responsible for creating the object 
	- we add service
	
there are three basic ways to add service
	- ServicesAddSingleton<IDrivable, Bus>()   -- like in IOC Container exmple
		- and then we should make the action drive know where will it recieve the data (so we write '[FromServices']) and this called method injection $$
                     
dataAtturibute is a subtype of the attribute 
what is the different between dataAnnotation and attributes

search for the code syntax for 2022 version 

configureservices(IServicesCollection services)
{
	services.AddSingleton<IDrivable, Bus>();
}


the injection method knows which service will use through the dependency injection 

	- create bus model 
	- create Idrivable interaface 
	- add services to the configureServices services.AddSingleton<IDrivable, Bus>();		=> applying the dependency injection
	- inside the controller in the action method we apply the injection method by using [FromServices] attribute 

first way to add service is addsingleton()
second way to add service is addTransient()
the different between first and second way is that the other way is create object each time if we used gethashcode we will find that each time create new object 
	- even if we open through another session 

the third way to add service is AddScoped()
	- all the action will use the same object
	- if there is another action then it will create another object for him and all the requests from that action will get the same object
	
	AddSingleton()
	AddScoped()
	AddTrainsient()
	
[wwwroot]

in libman.json
	{
		library
		files
		provider
		destination
	}
OR we can add it in lib we choose ad client-side library and include the library that you want 

site.css file we can declare variables on it 

wwwroot contain all static file
	images known by its extension and placed as static files in the wwwroot 
	when write src"" autmatically it will suggest wwwroot files
	
	if we put a static file in the outside inside the project we have to let the project knows that there is a static file outside not inside the wwwroot
	app.useStaticFiles(
		new StaticFileOptions()
		
		{
			FileProvider = new PhysicalFileProvider(Path, Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), "Images")),
			RequestPath = "/Pic"
		}
	)

===================== [ Day Seven ] =======================


responsibility => concrete class
dependency => abstraction (and service provider)

what is injection [ method / constructor / method ]
IOC container 
we have to let the injectedmethod to know where it will recieve data [FromServices] attribute

we don't install packages from NUGet
install is called restore through two methods 
	[Json (lib)]
	[wizard]
	
wwwroot made for static files 
	- we can put it outside put we add extra configration to let him know that there is another path that contain static files

a level of security to hide files names and action names for the user to use a words that I specify

[Code first from database or from scratch]
	- both we can do migration on them 
	- if we do any modification it will drop the tables and build it from the beginning
	

Project Name: asp.net core wep application (controller - view - model)
onConfigure event is important to understand in the upcomming steps

how to bring database to the mvc project 
	- use package manger console to bring that data 
	- we need connection string as first step to bring the data and add meta data that descripe the connection between me and the database
	- we use command : scaffold-dbcontext (search for the full path of the command)
		- this command have [server] [databasename] [trusted connection t/f][include prvoider name which is sql server] [where to locate the database like (OutDir Models)]
	- after entering the command if it throw error then probably there is a missing package 
		- to fix this issue (by default the project he is not installing the ef)
			- so we install [ef tools] and [ef sqlserver] core versions 
	- we write the command again and it will run correctly
	- optionBuilder.UseSqlServer("connection string") in this line we'll find a note with it to delete this line 
		- this line inside event onConfiguring method 
		- we suppose to remove the previous line and write another method
		- in the appsettings.json file that is equivalent to appconifg
		- we add "ConnectionStrings":{"write the connection string here"}	in the mvc 5 was added automatically when  adding data to the project 
			- we shoule let the server or the project to know that here is my connecction string 
			- we add service in congigureServices
				// why we add one type not two like in the previous exmple in day six
				Services.AddDbContext<SchoolDBContext>)(			//DBContext in configureServices
				{
					options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("Connection String Name"))
				}
				); // configuration holds all things in the appstttings.json where we added the connection string on it				
	- now we create a controller for each one // note that we rebuild the project to make sense the autogenerated code
	- we create the contorller then and in the contorller we create a context from the SchoolDBContext which I added to the project
		- SchoolDBContext context = new SchoolDBContext();
			we can define the context without initialization and make a constructor for the contorller and initialize it inside the constructor 
			make the construcotr receive data from type SchoolDBContext _context){context = _context}
			handler is responsible for fullfill the the constructor and I don't have to write [FromServices] because handler will fullfill the parameter 
				- note that we write the line of codes in the ConfigureServices
				- there is no way that the action call from the request by the user 

	- the command in the console is 
		Scaffold-DbContext "Server=DESKTOP-Q90E6U2;Database=ITI;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -OutputDir Models
			- just change the name of the database

- we have view start and view imports
	- we write in the imports all the name spaces that I'm going to unit them on all views $$
		- @addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
		- also we have @using MVCDemoDay7.Models	// which responsibile for Models
		- @using MVCDemoDay7
			- [ MVCDemoDay7 ] is the project name $
	
	// like we did in mapRouting but in mvc5 we put the most general in the last but in mvc core we put it any where 
	what is app.useendpoints(endpoints=>
		endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
		name: "default2",
		pattern: "allStudetns",
		default = new{controller = "student", action = "Index", id = ... .optional}
		));
		
			- it goes inside the end point if the action with the same name as entered it will get out and try the other route unlike the mvc5
	we could use only the pattern without the default and replace each one the contorller and the action 
	we assign the SelectItem to viewdata and use it in  the creat.cshtml view in the project mvcdemoday7 project 
	html.editorFor() -- if the value is boolean type so it will make it a check box in the form
	@htlm.validationSummary() responsible for gathering all the validations in the upper part of the page
	@html.AntiForgeryToken()  responsible for forbidden the user to access 
	
	what does [bind()] attribute used for ?		// in the lec code it threw an error because of trying to inert a record with the id which is identity and we can't insert it 
		
	we put the savechange when adding the a new recore to the database  we put it in try and catch
	
attribute with the action and tag helpers

what is context.entry(Student)

[taghelpers]
	asp-action="edit" asp-controller="Student"
	
	asp-for="FullName" use it with the label and input with the same name 
	asp-validation-for="FullName"
	asp-route-id = @Item.Id in the anchor
	we make the input to make the post get it when posting after sumbit
	@Html.RenderPartialAsync("");
	what is th attribute [Route("/")] is used for ? won't let the client know the the real name of the action 
		- we write this attribute above the method 
		we can let it write the real name of the controller by writing [Route("{contoller}/virtual name of the action")]
		
		
		if we want to make the developer can't know the name of the action we put [ActionName("name of the action")]
			- put then we have to write the old name in all configuration
			- also we have a problem that we have to rename the view or pass the name of the view 
			
	the different between attribute route and action 
		- is that action change the name of the action and we have to change the all configuration that operate with that action 
		- route just change the appearance of the action in the url part
		- These features exsists from mvc 5

	what is the different between the filters and the pipeline 
		- pipeilne is like services such as the endpoints 
		- filters is like the attribute of route and aciton (not sure) have higher priority when route it will use the attribute 
	
How to upload image ?
	look in C# corner 

using nuget console in simulating the data 
	- add-migrate -d
	- varbinary(max) => []binary

[Razor Pages]
      asp.net core web app C# => razor page content 
      .NET 5.0
      template not have mvc
      
add database 
      -create folder name it Models
      - ef core tools & ef core sql server
	- in PMC Scaffold-dbContext search an get the full connection strng with it 
            - note that is didn't enable the default instance => . won't work you have to write the full path
      - add the connection string to the appsettings.json and then add service that use the name of the 
      - we don't have controller here ! we access the 
      - we don't have to determine which page will load with the model because it's already associative with the model 
            - return Page(); // whether we write it or not it will load it because it's associatted with it 
      - we can't load another page 
      
what is the rest link

      gathering some views inside a folder called area 
      @page => mean that it's a razor page not a normall view, without it the app won't run 
            - and it makes it understand that it not have a controller 
      @using razorPagesdemo.Models
            - we have to add the directive to the model in the _ViewStart.cshtml unlike the mvc added automatically 


how to send data from the view model to its view
what is model binder
      
redirect to action => redirect to page

      [BindProperty] // to make this prop 2 way binding for model binder
      public Models>Student Student {get; set;}
      -- one way binding we add the attribute to make it two way binding from themodel to the page and bring the modified data to the model again 

      we use asp-page instead of asp-controller/action used in anchors

what is thedifferent between key and dot notation?

context.Students.Find(id)      
      
@page "{id:int?}"       -- to make id as segment rather than query string 

context.Entry("Student") ....

razor pages on simple and small projects preferred 
what is mvpn that also used in the react and angular

[TempData] what does it use for ?
      -- we put it above the property and use it instead of TempData[]
      
Session
      - HttpContext.Session.GetString/SetString/GetInt32/SetInt32
      - in in the page check if it's not empty to use it inside the condition
      - we have to configure the session after app.UserRouting(); 
      - app.UseSession;
      - we have to add to the services
      - services.AddSession();
      
      missed 03:20:00
      
what is wpf => customizable windows form (you draw )
      
      
      
================================= [ Day Nine ] =================================
	
merging between Mvc and razor page 

we create main project (Main) and we merge the other projcet file 
      - asp.net core web app   
      - create required files like views models controllers pages => carefull about naming conventions
      - in the services AddControllerWithViews();
      - app.MapRazorPages();
      - code first 
            - adding model files classes and add the relation between them and don't forget the virtual navigation property
            - adding annotation attribute for validation 
            - adding ef packages Tools, SqlServer, (SqlProvider??) reqruied for migration 
            - creat the context creator class and inherit from DbContext and add constructors
                  public ** ():base();
                  public ** (** options):base(optoins)
            - add the connection string in appsettings.json
            - inject in services (add to services in program)
                  builder.Services.AddDbContext<Model>(o => o.UseSqlServer(builcer.Configuration.GetConnectionString("ConnectionName")));
            
            -- build recommended if there is any error 
            -in PMC write

                  - add-migration mi
                  - update-database
            - you will find folder named Migrations
            
            configure the constructors of the model connection to create database if not exisis and initialize it 
                        
      - add controller and work normally
      
asp-page

we could create mvc and include razor files or create razor pages and include mvc files

[Identity]
      Authentication
      Authorization

cookie, Tokens, Claim

use Tokens exist or not => then match that code
      get the information of the client and then generate another code for him and send it for him
      
Claims => filtering the output depend on the properties of the client => like age and recommended products for that age


-- # -- Create MVC project and then add RazorPages files to the project 
      - asp.net core web app (model-view-controller)

            update-Database
      
      make sure that connection string is suitable for you 
            - in case sqlExpress was written but we don't have it 
      
      in the sql server you'll find the tables required

[Identity]

      [To Apply Identity]
      - Create Project with mvc or razor page
      - Choose Individual Idnetity in Authontication Type
      
      [To Update Database]
      - Check the connection string in appsetting.json file

      - Choose Identity => Ok
      - Choose wanted parts to be added for suctomization
            [ Register / Login / Access Denied / Logout / Index ]
            
      [To Customize Identity User]
      - Add New Class in Data Folder (we could do it in the model but we're separating the files) that inherits from the Idnetity User
      - Add your Custom properties inside it with its data annotation attributes
      - change ApplicationDbContext - make it inherits from generic IdentityDbContext<YourCustomIdentityUserClass,IdentityRole,string>
      - go to Identity registerd service and change it from AddDefaultIdentity<IdentityUser> to AddDefaultIdentity<YourCustomUser>
      - navigate all parts that using old identity user to the new one  and change them all 
      - add-migration
      - updata-database to map new columns
      
      [To Add IdentityRole]
      - go to registerd service change it from AddDefaultIdentity to AddIdentity<YourcustomIdentityUserclass/IdentityUser, >
      - AddRazorPages() in services 
      - Remove all EmailConfirmationManger and logger from ctor injection (not regiesterd with AddIdentity)
      - Add role part in your project 
      - add app.UseCookiePlicy() after staticfiles in pipline
      - Add Configuration to correct Login Path & AccessDenied Path
            @

      [To Authorize your Contorllers]
      - Authorize for allowing logged in useres only 
      - Authorize(Role="Rolename,..") for allowing users with specific role/s
      - AllowAnonymouse for sckipping Identity in this action
       
       

[ Bring Data From Database ]  // using scaffold
      1- Add WWWROOT files (static files)
            restore bootstrap
            restore jquery
            restore jquery.validate
            restore jquery.validate.unobtrusive
            
      2- install entity framework packages
            Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
            Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools


      3- make connection and get the data from the database using the below command line don't forget to write you Server name 
            - this line will get the tables from the database as classes in the model
            @Scaffold-DbContext "Server=DESKTOP-K0DUDSA;Database=ModelData;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -OutputDir Models

      4- open appsettings.json and write the connection string with the name of the connection and name of the server like 
            @"ConnectionStrings": { "Connection": "Server=.;Database=ModelData;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True" }

      5- Add it to the services and with type of the DbContext Classes that created after using the upper command
            - hash the inner code in the onConfigure event in the creates class that inherits from the DbContext
            - in program add service to the 
                  @ builder.Services.AddDbContext<ModelDataContext>(options => options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("Connection")));
                        -ModelDataContext is the class which inherits from DbContext in models 


      6- after that to use the database we don't create it like we used to in older version by using 
            -@ Model context = new Model();      instead we make a constructor injection in the controller like
            - @         
                  ModelDataContext context;
                  public CrudController(ModelDataContext _context)
                  {
                  context = _context;
                  }   
       
How does the server know which person is logged in?
      - [ Authentication Tokens ]
      - [ Session Cookies ]
      - [ Json Web Tokens (JWT) ]
